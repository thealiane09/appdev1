        <h2>Why I Want to Learn React</h2>
        <p>
          I want to learn React because Iâ€™m curious how websites actually work. Even if Iâ€™m not
          really into coding, I think itâ€™s good to know the basics, and maybe Iâ€™ll discover something
          fun or useful along the way.
