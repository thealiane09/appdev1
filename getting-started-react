## Why I Want to Learn Git & GitHub

I want to learn Git and GitHub because I I consider Git and GitHub important tools for project management, teamwork, and keeping track of changes. As a BSIS student and future Business Analyst, I want to gain insight into how developers structure their work, manage version control, and deal with project conflicts.
